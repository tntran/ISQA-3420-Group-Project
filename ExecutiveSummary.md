Executive Summary
----------------------------
Problem
----------------------------

Community is vital to an open source community, having a open source license isn't enough to bring together users and developers alone to build a project and community.  Projects start by someone needing to develop a project that intends to meet the need of others. Since  open source code can be used by anyone but need to do that under the license agreement specified within the package. Because there are alot of open source code out there, licences become an important factor to keep 

----------------------------
Solution
----------------------------

To allow the open source software and code to be legal. The solution for that is to design a better handle the licensing and vulnerabilities. However, this should create a big gap between the campany and the open source community. The system itseft need to 
enable to identify the package information based on the licenses and vulnerabilities. This is not just benefit for the developer but also give credential for the open source community.
