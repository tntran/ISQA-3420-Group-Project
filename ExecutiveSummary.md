THE PROBLEM
Seldin is a company that provides housing for lease mostly to those low income base or government project. However, Seldin currently has no system that can keep track associate database by property. The top management have a hard time to keep track which property still have tenant and whether or not it still operable. It costs valuable time for the company to verify and report in order for them to use the property again. Seldin has requested a new management database to work alongside with the associate data by property.
