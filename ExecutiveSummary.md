THE PROBLEM

Seldin is a company that provides housing for lease mostly to those low income base or government project. However, Seldin currently has no system that can keep track associate database by property. The top management have a hard time to keep track which property still have tenant and whether or not it still operable. It costs valuable time for the company to verify and report in order for them to use the property again. Seldin has requested a new management database to work alongside with the associate data by property.

THE SOLUTION

For the solution, we will create a database using the management principles so that the management can have access to all the information of the associate data combined with the assets they manage. The application should be able to identify the hierarchy so that only the right person can access to either edit or make report to higher chain of command.
